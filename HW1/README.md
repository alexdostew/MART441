## Homework 1 Readme

This project took a bit longer than I originally thought it would. Having working in web design before, I figured I could just jump back into it, but it seems I've forgotten a lot more than I expected.

There were a few things that took me a bit longer to work out.
- Vertical alignment of block elements
- parallax-like scrolling background images
- flex elements
- media queries

I mostly used the breakpoints to change the text size as screens get smaller, as well as making some of the block elements stretch to the edges when they're alone in a row, thanks to flex wrapping.

Overall this project was a great way to re-learn a lot of techniques I had forgotten about.
