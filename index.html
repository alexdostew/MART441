          <h2>Work & School</h2>
          <p>
            After two years of computer science at Montana State University, I left to pursue an internship at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. There, I spent another two years learning web design, medical illustration
            and 3D animation.
          </p>

          <p>
            After my internship ended, I decided to continue my path into animation and a more creative career, so I ended up back here at the University of Montana.

          <h2>Life & Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            When I'm not working on my school work, I enjoy skiing in the winter, rafting in the summer, and drawing all year round. I also spend a good amount of time playing video games. My current favorites are Rocket League and Escape From Tarkov.

          <p>
            Overall, I've worked in a lot of different fields and professional environments.
            I've used industry standard programs to create hyper-realistic 3D models for the medical field,
            I've worked in a large web design company working on multiple large-scale projects.
            <br />
            I've also learned multiple programming languages including C#, C++ and Java, and in the past used a lot of JavaScript with JQuery and AngularJS.
            <br />
            <br /> Most of the skills I've learned were self-taught on the job, which has helped me adapt to many different situations that I may have not been prepared for.
